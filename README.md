# MiGhettoPD

Over the past 12 hours, I've built an HUD, Killfeed, and Toast notification system using Vue, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases my skills in creating dynamic, and visually appealing features for the server.

## Features

### HUD
The HUD component I developed offers customizable pages, allowing the other devs to tailor the interface as needed.

### Killfeed
The Custom Killfeed feature utilizes a clean, red, black, and white color scheme to clearly display player kills and interactions.

### Toast Notifications
The Toast notification system I implemented provides a seamless way to deliver real-time feedback to players.

## Aesthetics
The aesthetic of the project is thanks to the fonts MartianMonoNerdFont and HurmitNerdFont, along with the MiGhetto colors.

All the menu sounds were made in FL Studio.

## Technologies Used
- Vue.js
